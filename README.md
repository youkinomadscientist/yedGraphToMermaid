# graphml2mermaid

> **Note**
> This project is a fork and enhancement of the original [graphml2mermaid by Mike Bergmann](https://github.com/MikeBergmann/graphml2mermaid).
>
> The core improvements in this version include:
> - A new Python script (`yfiles2mermaid.py`) to directly convert complex GraphML files generated by yEd / yFiles.
> - Support for extracting node text color from the yFiles GraphML and applying it to the Mermaid output.
> - Addition of a `requirements.txt` and a `.gitignore` for better project structure.

Example scripts how to convert simple graphlml files generated via python and networkx to mermaid graphs.
